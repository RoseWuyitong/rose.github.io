                    incredible experience. The course details, available on this website https://www.ntuclearninghub.com/en-gb/-/course/bread-making-basic-bread. 
                    
                    <br><br>The instructors were knowledgeable and passionate, making the learning process enjoyable. 
                    From understanding the basics of bread making to hands-on practice, the course provided a comprehensive foundation. 
                    The atmosphere was friendly and conducive to learning, allowing me to ask questions and receive 
                    guidance whenever needed.

                    I have always been captivated by Japanese culture, and my love for it began in primary school when I
                    started watching Japanese anime.
                    <br><br>One of the first anime series I watched was Natsume's Book of Friends (夏目友人帳), which
                    introduced me to the enchanting world of Japanese storytelling. However, my all-time favorite anime
                    has to be Fullmetal Alchemist (鋼の錬金術師). The intricate plot, compelling characters, and
                    thought-provoking themes resonated deeply with me.
                    <br><br> I am captivated by the world of vocaloid music and the enchanting character of Hatsune
                    Miku. Miku's digital persona and her distinctive voice have become iconic in the realm of Japanese
                    pop culture.
                    <br><br>Inspired by my passion for Janese culture, I took it upon myself to learn Japanese, starting
                    with
                    self-study aided by YouTube. I dedicated my efforts to mastering the Japanese language and achieved
                    a commendable result by attaining the N2 level proficiency.
                    <br><br>Although I am proud of this accomplishment, I acknowledge that there is still room for
                    improvement, and I remain committed to further refining my Japanese skills in the future.

                    As I previously mentioned, my love for Japanese culture extends beyond anime and language. I am an
                    avid attendee of concerts, particularly those featuring Japanese artists.
                    <br><br>Among my most memorable experiences are attending concerts by virtual singer Hatsune Miku
                    and rock band One Ok Rock. The energy, passion, and creativity that these performances exude are
                    truly captivating.
                    <br><br>In addition to Japanese artists, I have also had the privilege of attending concerts by
                    renowned Hong Kong singer Eason Chen. His soulful voice and heartfelt performances have left a
                    lasting impression on me. These concerts have not only allowed me to indulge in my passion for music
                    but have also provided a platform to connect with like-minded fans and immerse myself in the vibrant
                    atmosphere of live performances.

                <div>
                    During my first year abroad, which coincided with my time at UCL, I unfortunately developed a mild
                    eating disorder that had a detrimental impact on both my mental and physical well-being.
                    <br><br>It was an incredibly difficult period as I found myself gaining excessive weight, prompting
                    my doctor to recommend weight loss. However, I soon realized that traditional workouts felt like
                    torture to me. Despite this challenge, I persevered and embarked on a journey to find a balance
                    between nourishing my body and maintaining good health.
                    <br><br>Over time, I underwent significant changes in my mindset and began to appreciate and respect
                    my body instead of harboring feelings of self-hatred. I discovered a newfound love for weight
                    training, complemented by gentle cardio activities like swimming.
                    <br><br>Even while traveling, I found solace in working out as it helped alleviate fatigue and kept
                    me energized.

                    I have developed a deep fondness for playing the Rusty Lake series and have found myself revisiting
                    each game numerous times.
                    <br><br>The intricate and immersive nature of the series has captivated me, compelling me to delve
                    into the complex storylines with great enthusiasm. The depth of the narrative has motivated me to go
                    the extra mile by writing detailed explanations for each scene, piecing together the intricate
                    puzzle that Rusty Lake presents.

                    feel fresh and engaging. The combination of challenging puzzles, atmospheric visuals, and
                    thought-provoking storytelling has solidified Rusty Lake as one of my favorite gaming series,

                    <br><br>Throughout my life, I have been fortunate to embark on various travel adventures to

                    <br><br>During my younger years, I had the opportunity to visit Maldives and Thailand, where I was
                    enchanted by the pristine beaches and vibrant cultures.
                    <br><br>As a student at UCL in the UK, I often indulged in spontaneous solo trips, purchasing random
                    train tickets to explore different corners of the country.
                    <br><br>Singapore became a hub for memorable group travels with my friends, including visits to
                    captivating places such as Cambodia, Indonesia, UAE, and Sri Lanka.
                    <br><br>Among them, Sri Lanka holds a special place in my heart. Despite its reputation for danger,
                    I found it to be a haven of unparalleled beauty. The tranquil sea provided a healing experience,
                    while the enchanting tea factories offered a soothing ambiance. The people, predominantly Buddhist,
                    exuded kindness and generosity, leaving an indelible mark on my memery.
