                    <br>
                    I'm a dedicated and driven professional in the field of financial technology. With a Master's degree
                    in Financial Technology and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Economics, I possess a strong
                    foundation in both quantitative analysis and technological expertise.
                    <br><br>
                    As a Data Engineer at OCBC Bank, I've mastered trade comparing automation, tackled complex data
                    challenges and implemented solutions with precision and accuracy, ensuring efficient and streamlined
                    processes. At Singtel, I dabbled in Data Science, unravelling customer behaviour and leveraging
                    PySpark to drive insights.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond the tech realm, I'm fluent in English, Mandarin (native), and even Japanese (JLPT N2).

                    <br><br>
                    Outside of these, I engage in various activities that foster personal growth and balance. I enjoy
                    solving Sudoku puzzles to sharpen my analytical skills, (trying to...) maintain a disciplined
                    fitness regimen by lifting heavy weights, and exploring my creativity through the art of making
                    bread!
                    <br><br>
                    If you are searching for a versatile professional with a passion for fintech, strong language
                    skills, and a penchant for innovative thinking, I would be delighted to connect with you. Together,
                    we can navigate new frontiers, unravel complexities, and foster a mutually beneficial partnership.

                    <br>
                    I successfully spearheaded various projects at OCBC Malaysia, resulting in significant
                    improvements in efficiency and productivity. One notable achievement was the development of the OCBC
                    Malaysia ELI Trade Automation Smart Process Robot, which automated trade reconciliation for over 50
                    trade parameters. This innovative solution drastically reduced the processing time per trade from
                    over 40 minutes to less than 1 minute.

                    <br><br>Additionally, I created and implemented original solutions
                    that automated the comparison processes for different products. By taking on the processing of
                    approximately 1500 trades daily, these solutions relieved my colleagues of their workload and
                    eliminated human oversight errors.

                    <br><br>Furthermore, I played a key role in migrating our on-premises systems onto Jenkins, a
                    powerful automation tool. As part of this migration, I implemented the PyTest framework, enabling
                    automated
                    testing of Python scripts. This framework ensured a minimum of 80% code coverage, enhancing the
                    reliability and stability of our systems.

                    <br><br>In addition to these technical achievements, I also took on the responsibility of onboarding
                    numerous interns to our team. Through effective integration and seamless collaboration, I ensured
                    that the interns were able to contribute effectively to our projects, ultimately delivering
                    successful outcomes for the team.

                    <br>
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers started canceling or downgrading their network
                    subscriptions, I recognized the need to understand the evolving target customer base. Using PySpark,
                    I analyzed over 100,000 customers and more than 20 features, gaining valuable insights into their
                    changing behavior.

                    <br><br>By employing advanced analytics techniques, I assisted the management team in
                    implementing a new product structure. The clusters and labels generated through this analysis
                    identified the main target customers, enabling informed decisions on product offerings and marketing
                    strategies.

                    <br><br>Additionally, I conducted in-depth analysis of customer shakedown behavior, providing
                    crucial insights to higher management. This proactive approach helped the organization adapt and
                    align its products with the new target customer base, mitigating the impact of changing customer
                    behavior and ensuring continued growth and success.

                    During my pursuit of a Master's degree in Financial Technology (FinTech) at NTU, I had the
                    opportunity to work on a series of impactful projects. One notable project involved equity price
                    analytics, where I developed a Pairs Trading strategy by programming buy and sell signals using
                    Simple and Exponential Moving Averages. I also updated coding structures to generate long-short
                    pairs of equities, enhancing my skills in data analysis and algorithmic trading.

                    <br><br>In another project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), I tackled the issue of
                    online harassment by developing a model for toxic comment classification. By remodelling machine
                    learning methods, such as LSTM, I achieved better efficiency and accuracy compared to simpler models
                    like Logistic Regression. This project showcased my ability to apply advanced NLP techniques and
                    contribute to creating a safer online environment.

                    <br><br>Furthermore, I ventured into the realm of blockchain technology by designing a smart
                    contract using Solidity for car rental companies. This project aimed to streamline daily operations
                    and facilitate secure transactions within the industry, highlighting my capacity to integrate
                    innovative solutions into traditional sectors.

                    <br><br>Lastly, I explored human facial expression recognition by engineering models using PyTorch
                    and SKLearn. With a focus on deep learning techniques, I achieved a commendable accuracy of 76% in
                    identifying different facial expressions. This project demonstrated my proficiency in leveraging
                    state-of-the-art technologies to tackle complex challenges.

                    <br><br>Through these projects, I not only acquired technical expertise but also honed my analytical
                    and problem-solving skills. The experiences gained during my time at NTU have equipped me with a
                    strong foundation in FinTech and have prepared me to make valuable contributions in this dynamic
                    field.

                    <br><br>However, this individual's journey extended far beyond the confines of the classroom. Driven
                    by a deep sense of compassion and a desire to make a positive impact, they actively sought
                    opportunities to uplift and empower others. Recognizing the disparity in access to educational
                    resources, they took it upon themselves to prepare coding lectures and programs specifically
                    tailored for less-privileged children.

                    <br><br>With great enthusiasm, they taught Python lessons to these young learners, igniting their
